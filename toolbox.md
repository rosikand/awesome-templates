# LaTeX Toolbox

I plan to use this space to jot down useful LaTeX commands, tips, tricks, and more. 

---

- For a horizontal rule, use `\noindent\rule[0.5ex]{\linewidth}{0.3pt}`. 
- For squishing text together to reduce page numbers, use [savetrees](https://ctan.org/pkg/savetrees?lang=en). 
  - To use it, simply add `\usepackage[subtle]{savetrees}` or `\usepackage[moderate]{savetrees}` or `\usepackage[extreme]{savetrees}`. 
- Typography is a big thing in LaTeX which is why the Microtype package is popular by producing text that is quite appealing to the eye. Read more [here](http://www.khirevich.com/latex/microtype/). 
- Put an `[H]` after `\begin{figure}` to force the position of the image where it appears in the source.
